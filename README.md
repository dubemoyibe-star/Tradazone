## 📖 About the Project

Tradazone is a full-featured business management and payment product. It allows users to manage customers, create invoices, run checkout flows, and accept payments — including via Web3 wallets on the Stellar and Starknet networks.

The goal is to give small businesses and freelancers a **single, elegant dashboard** to handle their entire billing workflow, with the option to receive crypto payments without compromising the simplicity of a traditional invoicing tool.

### Key Features

- 🧾 **Invoice creation & PDF export** — Generate professional invoices and download them as PDFs
- 🛒 **Checkout flows** — Create shareable checkout links for products/services
- 📬 **Mail Checkout** — Send payment links directly to customers via email
- 👥 **Customer management** — Add, view, and manage your customer directory
- 📦 **Items & Services catalog** — Build a reusable catalog of your offerings
- 📊 **Dashboard analytics** — Visual overview of revenue and activity via Chart.js
- 🔐 **Authentication & Onboarding** — Sign up/in flows with a multi-step onboarding experience
- 🌐 **Web3 wallet support** — Connect Freighter (Stellar) and Starknet wallets for crypto payments
- ⚙️ **Settings** — Profile, password, notification, and payment configuration

## 📐 Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR 001: Selection of Tech Stack & Multi-chain Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: 
Tradazone aims to provide a seamless invoicing and payment experience across disparate blockchain ecosystems (Stellar, Starknet, EVM). This requires a frontend architecture that is highly performant, scalable, and capable of managing complex, asynchronous multi-chain states while maintaining a premium user interface.

**Decision**:
We have adopted the following core architectural components:
1.  **Foundation**: **React 19** and **Vite 7**.
2.  **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v3** for a utility-first design system.
3.  **State Management**: **React Context API** for global state (Auth and Data).
4.  **Integration Strategy**: A **Unified `AuthContext`** that abstracts blockchain-specific wallet logic (Freighter, Starknet.js, Ethers.js) into a single authentication interface.

**Rationale**:
- **Why Vite 7?**: Superior development velocity via instant HMR and highly optimized production builds using Rollup, essential for modern dApp development workflows.
- **Why React 19?**: Future-proofing the application with modern primitives (Actions, Transitions) that simplify the handling of asynchronous blockchain transactions and state updates.
- **Why Tailwind CSS?**: Facilitates the creation of a "premium" aesthetic with zero runtime CSS overhead, ensuring the application remains fast even as the UI complexity grows.
- **Why Context API?**: After evaluating Redux and Zustand, the native Context API was chosen for its simplicity and direct alignment with React 19’s data-fetching patterns, which is sufficient for the application's current and projected state complexity.
- **Why Unified Auth?**: Centralizing multi-chain logic in a single `AuthContext` reduces component-level complexity, simplifies protected route management, and provides a consistent developer experience when adding support for new networks.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Lightweight bundle size, ultra-fast UI response times, and a clear, modular architecture that lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors.
- **Negative**: Requires manual implementation of complex side effects that more prescriptive state management libraries would otherwise automate.
